      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
         JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed,
         prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is
         one
         of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive
         and
         provide online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers
         support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine. Each of the many JavaScript
         engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with
         some
         engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.
